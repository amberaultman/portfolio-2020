<section class='summary'>
<p class='large'>After 5 years of working fast and bootstrapped, the Tuft & Needle brand had become splintered across its various channels. The company had also grown beyond its early startup mentality and audience. We needed a refresh that would better attract new customers and align with the evolved ethos of the company.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 class='s4'>Building personas from research and analytics data</h2>
<p>In 2017, we began a research project to understand our customers and categorize them into persona groups. The team conducted 20 in-depth interviews with customers. Our goal was to speak with equal parts promoters, detractors, and cart abandoners. Reaching out to customers via email, we were not able to get any detractors to respond. And so we had to push forward with only promoters and abandon cart folks for our research. After talking to the abandon cart group, we realized that most of them were actually promoters. They had just chosen to buy from us through another channel, like Amazon. Using a recruiting service to ensure a more balanced participant group would have likely been more insightful. However, we were still able to glean meaningful insights into the types of people who bought from T&N.</p>
<p>After the team analyzed the interviews, we cross-referenced it with quantitative data from Google Analytics and Facebook. We identified four persona groups: Practical Shoppers, Fast Track Young Families, Empty Nesters, and Sensory Shoppers. While we found the same groups across all channels, each channel had a different ratio of persona types. For example, retail shoppers were much more likely to be Sensory Shoppers or Empty Nesters, Practical Shoppers tended to prefer making purchases on Amazon, and Fast Track Young Families typically purchased from tn.com or Amazon.</p>

<h2 class='s4'>Determining the workshop structure</h2>
<p>Sean Tucker and I worked closely to come up with an agenda that would meld the expertise of the various disciplines, allow people to think differently, educate them on human-centered design, and create the space for the goal output.</p>
<p class='no-image'>We decided to break the workshop up into two parts: a branding workshop and a digital workshop. Both groups contained designers, copywriters, marketers, and customer experience folks. But departments like engineering and PR were only included in the workshop relevant to them. We separated the workshops by two weeks to give the team time to recover and prepare.</p>

<section>
<h2 class='s4'>Audience, audit, and personality: the makings of a branding workshop</h2>
<h3 class='s5 begin-subsection'>Aligning on our personas</h3>
<p>On Monday, we focused on our audience. We shared the persona work and analytics data with the group. We then used a design thinking methodology to identify two other aspirational audiences who might be a good fit for Tuft & Needle. Once we had the six personas defined, we used empathy mapping to put ourselves in the mental headspace of each group.</p>

<h3 class='s5 begin-subsection'>A comprehensive audit</h3>
<p>The primary focus of Tuesday was on auditing the T&N brand across all channels. We pulled samples from every instance of the brand and hung them on massive pieces of foam core. With sticky notes in hand, participants then analyzed the output.</p>

<h3 class='s5 begin-subsection'>Establishing our personality</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, we focused on messaging, personality, and voice. We showed examples of a messaging map and then had the team ideate on the attributes and benefits for Tuft & Needle.</p>

</figure>
<p class='subsection-no-header'>We also created a brand map to identify where we sit amongst our competitors regarding quality and price, two primary attributes for our brand. This exercise helped us better understand the competitive landscape as well as identify gaps where we might gain a competitive advantage.</p>

<h3 class='s5 begin-subsection'>Making it visual</h3>
<p>Finally, we divided the group into teams and gave each one a large handful of typography, color, illustration, photography, and messaging samples. Each group created a mood board of the pieces that they felt would resonate with their persona and discarded any items that they felt might alienate them.</p>

<h2 class='s4'>A digital workshop of journeys, debt, and how-might-we’s</h2>
<p>We kicked off the digital workshop with a review of the brand audit, focusing mostly on the digital components. We then looked at competitors and completed SWOT analyses for each. Finally, we ended the day by making a list of the tech and design debt accrued over the last five years.</p>

<h3 class='s5 begin-subsection'>Exploring customer journeys</h3>
<p>We started day two with customer journeys. Each group ideated on their persona’s motivations for why they might want a new mattress. I then instructed them to think about potential channels where this persona might find T&N. From this entry point, the groups mapped out the likely journeys through our site. Finally, they identified potential issues and information gaps in the flows.</p>

<strong>How-might-we ideation.</strong>
This is always my favorite part of any workshop. I love the blue sky thinking and being able to consider all possibilities, even the crazy ones. One of my favorite prompts here is to “come up with a terrible way to solve this problem.” You then have participants turn their terrible ideas into good ideas. Many times it unearths things you may not have considered before.

<h3 class='s5 begin-subsection'>Prioritizing with an Eisenhower matrix</h3>
<p class='no-image'>The last day of the digital workshop was spent finishing up the HMW ideation and then prioritizing the results. We mapped the final contenders on an Eisenhower matrix to identify the biggest and easiest wins.</p>

<section>
<h2 class='s4'>The next iteration of our brand emerges</h2>
<p>Over the next six months, the team finalized and implemented the updates to the brand. While we decided not to touch the logo, the refresh included new typography, expansion of the color palette, and a fresh photography style.</p>
<h3 class='s5 begin-subsection'>Typefaces with more personality</h3>
<p>The Tuft & Needle typography before the rebrand consisted mostly of Avenir with a little Trade Gothic peppered in. While these faces are very legible workhorses, we felt they lacked personality and approachability. The team settled on Tiempos and Apercu instead. Tiempos, used sparingly, provided a refreshing friendliness to the brand. Apercu, while modern and versatile like Avenir, added an approachability with its subtle curves.</p>
<figure class='img-1up'>
<img alt='A page showing how our type styles might be used to communicate together.

<h3 class='s5 begin-subsection'>An expanded color palette</h3>
<p>Before the rebrand, Tuft & Needle’s minimal color palette consisted of the T&N Mint and several shades of gray. One of the ways identified in the branding workshop to appeal to a broader audience was to add muted secondary colors to warm and soften the brand.</p>
<figure class='img-1up'>
<img alt='A sheet from our brand book establishing our main brand colors and their pantones and other color values.' class='lazy' data-sizes='(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px' data-src='../images/tnbrand-13a-1400.jpg' data-srcset='../images/tnbrand-13a-500.jpg 500w, ../images/tnbrand-13a-1000.jpg 1000w, ../images/tnbrand-13a-1400.jpg 1400w, ../images/tnbrand-13a-2800.jpg 2800w'>

<h3 class='s5 begin-subsection'>Photography that is aspirational yet approachable</h3>
<p>Above all, we wanted the new photography to feel real, lived-in, and comfortable. This meant choosing authentic locations with lots of texture and architectural detail, better casting talent for on-camera chemistry, more candid talent direction, and triple washing all linens before the shoot to give them a natural, broken-in feel.  This approach was in stark contrast to T&N’s previous style, which focused on almost other-worldly perfection with floating drop shadows and texture dutifully photoshopped out.</p>
