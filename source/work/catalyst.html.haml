            %h6.s6 Problem
            %p Although Ignite was created to disrupt Adecco from within, we soon realized that we needed to shift their mindsets if we were going to affect real change in the company.
        .result
            %h6.s6 Result
            %p We created Catalyst, a custom design-thinking workshop method. Over the course of 2 years, we held over 20 two-day workshops, both internally for Adecco and externally for small businesses.

        %p.large Ignite was started as an incubator inside of the global staffing behemoth Adecco. The goal was to disrupt from the inside inorder to avoid disruption from the outside. While we had the buy-in from executive leadership, getting the rest of the company on board proved to be a challenge. The people doing the actual lifting at Adecco needed a new way of thinking inorder to come up with creative solutions to their pressing issues.......... Provide internal and external design thinking workshops to help teams approach their problems creatively.......

    %section
        %h2.s4 A human-first approach
        %p At most of the Catalyst workshops, I gave a talk on the importance of the human element in business. I would walk workshop attendees through the value of human-centered design, using real examples of ways companies have used this to create extraordinary experiences, making them standout in the marketplace.

        %h2.s4 Setting the stage with personas
        %p Creating personas is an important part of the workshop process. Itâ€™s the foundation on which the rest of the exercises are built. Getting people up and moving helps them be more creative and work as a team.

        %h2.s4 A customized experience
        %p From small groups to large, internal to external, products to services, each Catalyst workshop was customized to fit the needs of its attendees. Anthony Catanese, our product manager, did a wonderful job creating a flexible structure that could be easily manipulated depending on the needs of the group.

        %h2.s4 Ah, the marshmallow challenge
        %p The marshmallow challenge was usually a favorite among attendees. We used the hands-on activity to illustrate the importance of creating prototypes, reserving judgement, working together as a team, starting with the most important thing first, and iterating.

        %h2.s4 Unleashing creativity
        %p One of the best parts of facilitating these workshops was watching people step into their own creativity. Some people struggled more than others, and some people fought hard against it, but by the end of each session almost everyone was thinking differently.
